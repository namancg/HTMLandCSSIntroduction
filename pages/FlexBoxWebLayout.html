                    <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the
                        centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two
                        bails balanced on three stumps. The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the
                        bowler, "bowls" (propels) the ball from one end of the pitch towards the wicket at the other
                        end. The batting side's players score runs by striking the bowled ball with a bat and running
                        between the wickets, while the bowling side tries to prevent this by keeping the ball within the
                        field and getting it to either wicket, and dismiss each batter (so they are "out"). Means of
                        dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by
                        the fielding side either catching a hit ball before it touches the ground, or hitting a wicket
                        with the ball before a batter can cross the crease line in front of the wicket to complete a
                        run. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game
                        is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international
                        matches.</p>

                    <p>Coronaviruses are a group of related RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In
                        humans and birds, they cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal.
                        Mild illnesses in humans include some cases of the common cold (which is also caused by other
                        viruses, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties can cause SARS, MERS, and
                        COVID-19. In cows and pigs they cause diarrhea, while in mice they cause hepatitis and
                        encephalomyelitis..</p>
